# React New Window

Pop new windows in React, using `window.open`.

Inspired by [David Gilbertson's article](https://hackernoon.com/using-a-react-16-portal-to-do-something-cool-2a2d627b0202) (must read, must follow).

</div>

## Features

 - **Only 2.68KB** (gzipped!).
 - **Support the full `window.open` api**.
 - **Built for React 16** (uses `ReactDOM.createPortal`).
 - **Handler for blocked popups** (via `onBlock` prop).
 - **Center popups** according to the parent _window_ or _screen_.

## Installation

  - `npm install react-new-window --save`

    or 

  - `yarn add react-new-window`

## Usage

```js
import React from 'react'
import NewWindow from 'react-new-window'

const Demo = () => (
  <NewWindow>
    <h1>Hi 👋</h1>
  </NewWindow>
)
```

When **`<NewWindow />`** is mounted a popup window will be opened. When unmounted then the popup will be closed.

The `children` contents is what will be rendered into the new popup window. In that case `Hi 👋` will be the content. The content can include any react-stateful code.
